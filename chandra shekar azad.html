  <p>Chandrasekhar Azad, original name <b>Chandrasekhar Tiwari</b>, Chandrasekhar also spelled Chandrashekhar or Chandra Shekhar, (born <b>July 23, 1906, Bhabra, India—died February 27, 1931, Allahabad)</b>, Indian revolutionary who organized and led a band of militant youth during India’s independence movement.</p>

 <p>Azad was drawn into the Indian national movement at a young age. When apprehended by the police at age 15 while participating in Mohandas K. Gandhi’s noncooperation movement (1920–22) at Banares (now Varanasi), he gave his name as Azad (Urdu: “Free” or “Liberated”) and his address as “prison.” Although because of his age he was not imprisoned, he was given a severe flogging by the police. The Indian National Congress (Congress Party) soon lionized him, and he gained popularity among the Indian people.</p>
